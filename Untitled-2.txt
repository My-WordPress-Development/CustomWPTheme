          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
          This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

     <h1>"Hello, World!" program</h1>
     <p id="ptxt-light">
         A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays
         "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages,
         it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working
         program, and as such is often the very first program people write.
     </p>
     <h2>Purpose</h2>
     <p id="ptxt-light">
         A "Hello, World!" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a
         programming language. "Hello, world!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test
         to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator
         understands how to use it.

<?php
$url = 'http://yourdomain.com/blog/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=5'; // Adjust the URL to match your WordPress site

$response = file_get_contents($url);

if ($response === false) {
    // Handle errors
    echo 'Unable to fetch posts.';
} else {
    $posts = json_decode($response);

    if (!empty($posts)) {
        echo '<ul>';
        foreach ($posts as $post) {
            echo '<li><a href="' . esc_url($post->link) . '">' . esc_html($post->title->rendered) . '</a></li>';

The main difference is <span> is an inline element primarily used for styling text or elements within text, <div> is a block element used for grouping and structuring content into larger sections or blocks, often for layout purposes.

"==" 
It compares the values on both sides for equality after type coercion.

"===" 
It compares both the values and their data types without type coercion.


========

"display: none" completely removes the element from the layout, making it invisible and not occupy any space.
"visibility: hidden" hides the element but keeps it in the layout, preserving its space.

"Cookies" are suitable for small, frequently used data, both for session and persistent storage.
"sessionStorage" is used for temporary data storage within a single page session.
"localStorage" is used for storing data that should persist across browser sessions and is accessible across tabs and windows from the same domain.

====

Reset CSS: Choose a CSS reset if you want complete control over styling and prefer to start from a clean slate. This approach can be beneficial when you want to create a highly customized design without any assumptions about default styles.

Normalize CSS: Choose CSS normalization if you want a more consistent and predictable starting point that retains some of the default styling. It's especially useful when you want to maintain a balance between a consistent user experience across browsers and the flexibility to define your styles.

The choice depends on your project's requirements and your design preferences. If you prefer to control every aspect of styling and don't want any assumptions about default styles, go for a reset. If you want a more consistent baseline to work from and are comfortable with some default styles, normalization is a good choice. Additionally, some projects may use a combination of both techniques, depending on specific needs.
